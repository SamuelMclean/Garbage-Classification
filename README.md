# Garbage Classification
## Overview

This Project's ultimate goal is to use an image of garbage to identify which bin color the rubbish should go into.

## Motivation
This was a project for SIT319 Deep Learning, but I enjoyed doing it


## Replication
#### Used Libraries and Versions:
* Python 3.12
* Tensorflow 2.x
* sklearn 1.5
* pandas 2.x
* matplotlib 3.9

Other versions are likely to work but these are just what I used

1. Download the dataset from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification)
2. Run the code in the notebook with the extracted dataset in the same folder.
